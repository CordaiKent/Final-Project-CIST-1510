        <p>What I like most about learning html and css is easy it is to understand html.
            I am slowly learning css and it is fun to be able to understand how to code like this.
        I also like seeing how my code creates a webpage just from typing in <b>Visual Studio Code.</b>
        Just being able to create like this is fun to me. 
    </p>
    <p>What I like least about learning html and css is actually the css part.
        It is slightly more difficult to understand than html and I am struggling a bit with it. Having to incorporaite
        Css into my html files threw me off a bit, but im understanding it bit by bit.
